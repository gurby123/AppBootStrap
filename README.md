# Overview of CICD Plan
The idea was to develop and test a MIT licensed multipage Bootstrap/JavaScript template repository so that it could be easily replicated and deployed for future website development. Any changes to the website should automatically trigger a test before it is merged into the project. 

# GitHub Demo
The website can be viewed at https://gurby123.github.io/AppBootStrap/
The images on this website are not free and are only for demo purposes. 

# WorkFlow
The website was retrieved for a Themefisher demo with an MIT license. The workflow file was added to monitor and test it before deployment. It was tested on Node.js 12.x, 14.x and 16.x. So far the tests have all failed. I am still on completing the integration stage so that I can progress to the deployment phase at a private server. 

# Docker1 

The Docker file with ALPINE and python broke the images and hyperlinks of the website giving a skeletal website witohut the bells and wistles of CSS and SASS. 

Dockerfile code was as follows:
FROM alpine
MAINTAINER uli.hitzel@gmail.com
EXPOSE 8080
RUN apk update
RUN apk add python2
COPY index.html /tmp/index.html
COPY start.sh /tmp/start.sh
USER 1000
CMD ["sh","/tmp/start.sh"]

start.sh was as follows: 
cd /tmp
mkdir www
cp index.html www
echo "<hr>Running on $(hostname)" >> www/index.html
cd www
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080

Docker Build command was as follows:
docker build . -t  appbootstrap

Docker run command was as follows:
docker run -d -p 8080:8080 appbootstrap

# Docker2
Still install python to display index.html but also installed node.js, npm and gulp. There was no inprovement with navigating hyperlinks, images and CSS

The Dockerfile code is as follows:
FROM mhart/alpine-node:latest

RUN apk update
RUN apk add python2	

WORKDIR /usr/src/app
RUN apk add --update nodejs nodejs-npm
COPY package*.json ./
RUN  npm install

RUN npm install -g gulp

COPY index.html /tmp/index.html
COPY start.sh /tmp/start.sh
USER 1000
CMD ["sh","/tmp/start.sh"]

Docker build command:
docker build . -t  appbootstrap3

Docker run command:
docker run -d -p 8080:8080 appbootstrap3

# Docker3

FROM ubuntu:18.04
MAINTAINER uli.hitzel@gmail.com
EXPOSE 8080
ARG DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive
ENV TZ=Asia/Singapore

RUN apt-get update
RUN apt-get install -y nodejs npm
ENV USER root
RUN npm install -g express-generator
RUN npm install express --save
RUN useradd -ms /bin/bash user
COPY app.js /home/user/app.js
COPY start.sh /home/user/start.sh
RUN chmod a+x /home/user/start.sh
USER user
WORKDIR /home/user

CMD ["sh","/home/user/start.sh"]

# Lessons Learned

Even though the demo HTML website works out of the box, because of it bootstrap features, it tends to fails with numerous node.js dependencies that have been deprecated. A related problem is that the global gulp.cli needs to be installed and it requires the sudo command. It may therefore not be practical or possible to create a docker image in the normal way and as the gulp dependecy may need to be pre-installed in the linux distro.
